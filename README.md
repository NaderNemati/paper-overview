# Multimodal Generative Deep Learning for ECG Image Digitization and Reconstruction

## Abstract

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide reliable information about cardiovascular health by detecting arrhythmias. However, many historical ECG records exist only in paper format, presenting challenges for modern diagnostic tools. Digitizing these records is crucial to developing comprehensive datasets that cover a wide range of clinical conditions. In this study, we propose a multimodal generative deep learning framework that reconstructs digital ECG signals from ECG images by training on paired image-signal data, where raw ECG signals serve as ground-truth labels to improve the accuracy of reconstruction waveforms. Our method produces high-quality digital ECG signals that integrate seamlessly with modern diagnostic equipment. The model demonstrates robust generalization across diverse datasets, facilitating accurate automated diagnosis and faithful reconstruction of legacy ECG records for modern clinical use.

## Paper Summary

**Title:** Multimodal Generative Deep Learning for ECG Image Digitization and Reconstruction

Our work tackles the challenge of digitizing historical ECG records, which are often available only as scanned images or paper printouts. By fusing spatial features extracted from ECG images with temporal features from raw signals, our deep learning architecture reconstructs high-fidelity digital ECG waveforms. Key points include:

- **Data Preparation:** Synthetic ECG images are generated and enhanced using various preprocessing techniques, ensuring robustness to noise and artifacts.
- **Model Architecture:** The framework features an encoderâ€“decoder design that leverages both convolutional neural networks (for image processing) and fully connected layers (for signal processing) to form a unified latent representation.
- **Performance Evaluation:** The reconstructed ECG signals achieve significant improvements in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), underscoring the model's accuracy and clinical relevance.
